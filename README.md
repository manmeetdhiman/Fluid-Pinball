# Fluid-Pinball

## ENME Capstone Project 2020-21

There are three main components in this project: Genetic Algorithm, Reinforcement Learning, and CFD. 

There are two main algorithms used in this project. The first architecture is Genetic Algorithm (GA) and the details of it can be found under the folder "SOGA". The second architecture is Reinforcement Learning (RL) and the details of it can be found under the folder "RL". All scripts related to the CFD model and automation/integration of the architectures with teh CFD can be found in "automation" folder.
