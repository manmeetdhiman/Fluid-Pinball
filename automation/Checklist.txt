CHECKLIST:
    Change # of timesteps in GA/main.py and CFD/cfd.py (for GA)
    CFD/settings.py changes:
        Change TOTAL # of timesteps (not needed for RL)
        Change TIMESTEP_INTERVAL
        Change HOMEPATH
        Change JOB_FILE to appropriate *.slurm filenames
        Change cp command
        Change sleep time
    Change input parameters in worker.slurm. Change $HOME to RESULTS_FOLDER_PATH in CFD/settings.py
    Change cluster type in worker.slurm and corresponding cluster requests.
    dos2unix all slurm files
    Check that the fluent.slurm file has job name entry on 3rd line of file. This is because this job name is changed by the code.
    Check in .jou file to make sure that actuation/perturbation is turned on as required.
    Check each *.slurm file is requesting the appropriate resources/mem (e.g. don't need CPU2019 for extract_velocity)
    Check RL/GA settings
    Ensure RL toplevel.slurm is multicore! (e.g. 5 iterations/episodes = 5 cores)
    Change toplevel.slurm name, resources, etc.
    Change worker job names in submit_workers.py
    For the perturbed runs, make sure to use steady state TimeStep-0.cas
        from the perturbation simulations. (Also change to (time-step 0) in those files)


sim_files/ folder required files:
    *.jou (to control fluent)
    *.slurm (fluent)
    starting TimeStep* (e.g. TimeStep-0.cas/dat)

NOTES:
Motor_rotations.txt and inlet_velocity txt files will be generated however they will not
    be used unless the actuation flag and perturbation flag is turned on in the *.jou file

IF YOU CHANGE motor_rotations.txt, inlet_velocity.txt, and t_start.txt filenames, BE SURE TO CHANGE
THOSE NAMES IN THE .JOU FILE AS WELL!

The cwd where the *.slurm file is submitted is where the *.out files will go.
e.g. cwd = Results_GA/ but slurm file in Results_GA/individual-0-0-920/, 
     *.out file will go into Results_GA/ not into individual-0-0-920/ folder.
Only works for ascii output intervals of 5, 10 currently.
If extending a simulation (10k to 30k timesteps), make sure to also extend motor_parameters.txt. and inlet_velocity.txt.

toplevel.py and CFD/ folder need to be on the same level.
The assignment of cost in SOGA/functions.py is very important. Make sure cost is not assigned to the wrong individual.
